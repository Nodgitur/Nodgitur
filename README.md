Over the past few years of study I have developed my skills across my studies and in the indsutry. My repositories include projects from various technologies and 
computing languages. 

My most recent project is Refreshments, which can be viewed within its repo. It is a functional recipe filter Android application that allows you to search for recipes based on ingredients criteria.

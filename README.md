Hi, my name is Adam. I'm a soon to be BSc Honours Computing graduate from National College of Ireland.

Over the past few years of study I have developed my skills across my studies and in the indsutry. My repositories include projects from various technologies and 
computing langauges. 

Currently, I'm trying to develop my Kotlin and Java expertise as I have gained an interest in Android from completing my final year project.
I hope to improve my skills further through creating personal projects and providing classes for students at National College of Ireland.

I have years of experience tinkering with data analytics and displaying the metrics through thoughtful UI/UX design, and would love to work in this field in 
the coming months.

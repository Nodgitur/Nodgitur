Over the past few years of study I have developed my skills across my studies and in the indsutry. My repositories include projects from various technologies and 
computing langauges. 

I recently did a 5 month internship with AMS through Deloitte in the area of DevOps where I designed full stack projects and presented them to Deloitte. I would love to look to work more in this area of the industry to learn new and build upon my DevOps skills.
